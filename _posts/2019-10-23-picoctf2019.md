I competed in picoCTF 2019, which ran from September 27th until October 11th. This year we competed as the team **ParrotsWin**, placing 14th in Canada amongst more than 700 teams, and 196th globally amongst more than 15000 teams. This was my first CTF event, and I'm overall satisfied with our results. I had an amazing time working with my friends to complete the challenges, and each of us contributed valuably to the team effort and our final result.
