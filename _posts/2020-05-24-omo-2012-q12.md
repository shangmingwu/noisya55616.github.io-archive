This is a pretty cool problem that a friend showed me. It looks harder than it is (which is good for me, because I'm not actually that good at math), and I think the solution is interesting for its simplicity. It's question 12 from the OMO Fall 2012 contest. Check out the problems from that season's OMO [here](http://internetolympiad.org/archive/OMOFall12/OMOFall12Probs.pdf), and check out the OMO in general [here.](http://internetolympiad.org/)

Let $$a_1,a_2,...$$ be a sequence defined by $$a_1 = 1$$ and for $$n \geq 1$$, $$a_{n+1} = \sqrt{a^{2}_{n} - 2a_n + 3} + 1$$. Find $$a_{513}$$.

Pretty interesting, huh? Let's dive into it.

Where do we start? Let's try just evaluating a few terms of the squence first.

We are given that $$a_1 = 1$$, so

$$\begin{eqnarray} 
a_2 &=& \sqrt{a^{2}_{1} - 2a_1 + 3} + 1      \nonumber \\
  &=& \sqrt{1^{2} - 2(1) + 3} + 1 \nonumber \\
  &=& \sqrt{1 - 2 + 3} + 1 \nonumber \\
  &=& \sqrt{2} + 1 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}$$

We can use $$a_2$$ to find $$a_3$$.

$$\begin{eqnarray} 
a_3 &=& \sqrt{a^{2}_{2} - 2a_2 + 3} + 1      \nonumber \\
  &=& \sqrt{(\sqrt{2} + 1)^{2} - 2(\sqrt{2} + 1) + 3} + 1 \nonumber \\
  &=& \sqrt{2 + 2\sqrt{2} + 1 - 2\sqrt{2} - 2 + 3} + 1 \nonumber \\
  &=& \sqrt{4} + 1 \nonumber \\
  &=& 2 + 1 \nonumber \\
  &=& 3 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}$$

Similarly, we can use $$a_3$$ to find $$a_4$$.

$$\begin{eqnarray} 
a_4 &=& \sqrt{a^{2}_{3} - 2a_3 + 3} + 1      \nonumber \\
  &=& \sqrt{3^{2} - 2(3) + 3} + 1 \nonumber \\
  &=& \sqrt{9 - 6 + 3} + 1 \nonumber \\
  &=& \sqrt{6} + 1 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}$$

Let's stop right here. What do you notice about these numbers? If we leave $$a_3$$ as $$\sqrt{4} + 1$$, it will be immediately apparent.

$$\begin{eqnarray}
a_1 &=& 1 = \sqrt{0} + 1 \nonumber \\
a_2 &=& \sqrt{2} + 1 \nonumber \\
a_3 &=& \sqrt{4} + 1 \nonumber \\
a_4 &=& \sqrt{6} + 1 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}$$

There's a pattern! For $$n \geq 1$$, $$a_n = \sqrt{2n-2} + 1$$. You can evaluate $$a_5$$ and $$a_6$$ and $$a_7$$ and beyond and you will find that this pattern continues.

So to answer the question, 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
a_{513} &=& \sqrt{2(513) - 2} + 1 \nonumber \\
   &=& \sqrt{1026 - 2} + 1 \nonumber \\
   &=& \sqrt{1024} + 1 \nonumber \\
   &=& 32 + 1 \nonumber \\
   &=& 33 \blacksquare \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}$$
