I competed in picoCTF once again this year, from March 15th until March 29th. After a satisfactory result in 2019, scheduling conflicts and workload prevented me from competing in picoCTF in 2020 and 2021, and I'm happy that I was able to compete again.

This year I competed with 4 of my friends as **WozeNest**. We placed 2nd on the Canadian High School leaderboard and 14th on the Global leaderboard amongst more than 7500 teams this year. This result places us amongst the best high school teams in Canada, and in line even with organized CTF teams and university CTF clubs around the world, and we're super proud of our placement this year.
