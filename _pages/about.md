## I'm in a transitionary period...

### ...of living situations

I've out of my parents' house, where I've spent my entire life up until now, into a dorm at the University of Waterloo. Nearly all of my time for the next 5 years will likely be away from home, as I'll be studying and working in co-op positions.

### ...of beliefs and worldviews

Along with the end of my high school education came a lot of experiences and a lot of people that have changed the way that I view and process the world around me, in many ways.

## I'm excited...

### ...to be agentic

I spent a lot of time in high school going with the flow, rarely deciding to exercise my agency to push for the things that I wanted. It was to the point that the lack of agency I was exercising in my life was getting in the way of what I desired out of my life experiences - I knew something had to change.

Starting with my decision to graduate from high school early, I've started to exercise my agency little by little. The prospects of independent living and the job search (both for co-op positions and for my career later on) looming on the horizon will be a new challenge for me and my agency.

### ...to make large changes

The next 5 years I spend studying will be a prime opportunity for me to enact large changes in my life. I'm starting to live independently, without my parents. Even physically, the next few years are years where it will be easy for me to gain and lose weight, muscle and generally alter my physique.
