        <!-- <p>I'm Simon Wu. I'm currently a student at The Woodlands Secondary School. I really like math, programming, physics and music, so that's what most of this site's content will be.</p> -->
        <p>I'm Simon Wu. I'm currently a student student at The Woodlands Secondary School, in Mississauga, Ontario.</p>
        <p>I started programming when I was 10, when I began an Arduino class. Ever since then, I've done all sorts of little Arduino projects that I hope to document here.</p>
        <!-- <p>I also enjoy modelling in Autodesk Inventor, competitive programming, DECA, music production with Garageband/Logic Pro X, math, and physics.</p> -->
        <p>Some things that interest me, that I might write about:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>Competitive Programming</li>
                <li>Competition-level math and physics</li>
                <li>Musical performance and music production</li>
                <li>The DECA competition (and my favourite cluster, marketing)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some things that I am reading right now or am looking to read:</p>
        <ul>
                <li><i>Crime and Punishment</i>, by Fyodor Dostoevsky (without the y; apparently this is the correct way). I heard that it was a good book.</li>
                <li><i>Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge</i>, by Paul Feyerabend. It's about the philosophy of science, where Feyerabend argues that science is not a nomic enterprise, and argues against the idea that only a single methodology (the scientific method) can produce scientific progress.
                        <ul>
                                <li>If you are interested in the book, you can find the first 1970 edition for free <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kagw36Q9B5VI6BY7xs55LMajEh4jsyw5/view">here</a>, through open access from the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science. Download the files with "Feyerabend" at the end, and the one with "Hanson" at the end to get the complete book and footnotes.</li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li><i>Euclidean Geometry in Mathematical Olympiads</i>, by Evan Chen. It's a heck of a book written by a heck of a guy, about geometrical concepts common in Olympiad-level math contests. You can find purchase links for a hard copy or the PDF <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/geombook.html">here.</a></li>
        </ul>
