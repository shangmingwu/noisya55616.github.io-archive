# Preamble

In this blog post, I'll be going over the topic that I've tentatively decided to proceed on in this project, and elaborating on how this idea and topic will be expressed in my personal project.

# Selected topic

The topic that I've decided to proceed on for now is **The Physics of Astronomical Spectroscopy**, the use of spectroscopy and the spectra of radiation emitted from stars and celestial bodies to study their properties and behaviours.

Some resources on what astronomical spectroscopy actually is:

[Astronomical spectroscopy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy)

[Spectroscopy - European Southern Observatory](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/technology/spectroscopy/)

## Research question

> What is the physics behind spectroscopy and how do spectra carry information about celestial bodies?

### Sub-questions

- How does spectroscopy equipment work?
- How do the physical properties and behaviours of celestial bodies affect their spectra?
- How do researchers interpret physical properties and behaviours from measured spectra?

### Product and demonstration ideas

- Build a crude spectrometer to split light into spectra for analysis, to demonstrate how spectroscopy equipment works.
    - This can be done with fairly cheap and easily accessible materials and equipment, in multiple ways (e.g. dispersive prisms, ready-made diffraction gratings, or diffraction grating improvised from other materials).
- Analyze theoretical and actual spectral data from stars and celestial bodies to demonstrate how physical properties and behaviours can be determined from spectral analysis.
    - This isn't really feasible with my own collected data, unfortunately, because of the light pollution in the local area and the prohibitive cost of professional spectroscopy equipment.
    - However, it's possible (depending on how well the home-build spectrometer turns out) that I will be able to analyze some light from lightbulbs and the sun to demonstrate differences in the spectra from their emitted light.

### Further connections

- I'd like to focus on astronomical spectroscopy in this project, but spectroscopy has a myriad of uses outside of astronomy.
    - It's used to analyze spectra to analyze elements, compounds in blood, and in material science to analyze material structure.
