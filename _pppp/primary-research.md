# Receiving materials for testing

I've just received this optical glass prism from Ajax Scientific.

I'll be using it to split light from various sources into a visible spectrum for viewing - stay tuned for updates on how this goes in the near future.

## Backup

Should my plans with this prism fail or other difficulties arise, I also have access to some CDs, which can act as diffraction gratings due to their groove patterns with a bit of destructive modification. It's what causes the rainbows you see on the shiny side of CDs! I plan on substituting those in for the prism in order to try and view some light spectra.

# Data collection for analysis

## Solar spectra

This is a plot of the [1985 Wehrli Standard Extraterrestrial Solar Irradiance Spectrum](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/solar-resource/spectra-wehrli.html), a set of solar spectrum data that is widely used for various meteorological and other purposes. The data was retrieved from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and plotted using R.

On the plot, you can immediately see several relevant features, such as the distinctive shape of the plot that indicates blackbody radiation, and the various spectral lines and dips in intensity that result from those spectral lines.

## Galactic brightness measurements

This is a plot of data taken at a constant galactic latitude: in this case, it is a plot of brightness temperature against line-of-sight velocity, which is used as an indicator of distance from the observer, which in this case is a satellite fairly close to the Earth.

From this data, several peaks indicating the various branches of the galaxy are easily distinguishable. Near the line-of-sight velocity of 0, which indicates that the measurement is very close to the observer, we see a peak that indicates our local branch of the galaxy, while the highest peak is indicative of the Perseus arm, which usually appears to be the brightest arm of the galaxy to an Earth observer.
