# Preamble

I've got a lot of ideas for topics that could yield a lot of cool physics to talk about for this project. That also means that I've got no ideas, because I'm too attached to every single one of them and I am paralyzed with the paradox of choice! So, I've narrowed everything down to two main areas that I think would be the coolest (because I like them the best).

# Spectroscopy in astronomy

Spectroscopy is used in astronomy to investigate the properties and behaviour of celestial bodies in many different ways. Spectra can be used to determine the color, chemical composition, movement and size of stars among other things.

## Possible areas of exploration

### The Rayleigh-Jeans law and the ultraviolet catastrophe

The Rayleigh-Jeans law was a law used to describe the intensity of electromagnetic radiation from stars (more generally, blackbodies), but it failed at low wavelengths (high frequencies) of radiation and described intensity that tended towards infinity, which wasn't what was being observed in the sky. This was called the ultraviolet catastrophe: later, different laws describing the behaviour of intensity of radiation from stars were derived.

I want to find spectral data from a few real stars and graph it against the predicted intensities from the Rayleigh-Jeans law, Wien's approximation and Planck's law. I think it will be cool!

### Analyzing spectra to determine information about stars

This is very, very general, but I'd like to display the techniques that are used to derive information about stars from spectral information and observations. Color indexes, wavelength-intensity graphs and spectral lines can tell you things like the effective/surface temperature of a star, the color of a star, and the movement of the star (through the Doppler effect).

### Deriving the Stefan-Boltzmann constant from a graph of spectra

If you integrate the area beneath an intensity-wavelength graph, you'll obtain the spectral intensity of the star. From this (as well as the effective temperature of the star derived through the Wien's displacement), you can then obtain an expression to solve for Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

# Video games

This is a branch that I'm less familiar with, but I think there are some cool things to explore.

## Possible areas of exploration

### Lighting physics and approximations

Ray tracing technologies, shadow maps, reflection maps and other technologies are used to simulate lighting physics inside of video games. There are a lot of techniques that I could research and explain in relation to the actual physics of the situations that they are trying to simulate and display, which I think would be really cool.

### Devices and their inner workings

Consoles and controllers have a lot of components and inner workings that are pretty cool to examine from a physics perspective. Controller sticks, for example, use potentiometers that measure each axis of movement, and potentiometers have a pretty cool mechanism: I even own a standalone control stick that I could show, so that I don't have to destroy once of my controllers.
