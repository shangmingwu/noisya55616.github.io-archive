I'm participating in m0lecon 2020, a CTF competition, which starts today. 

## What is a CTF?

A CTF (capture the flag) competition is an event where individuals or teams are given challenges to solve, in order to obtain *flags*, which are usually strings
that, once found and submitted, earn your team points. The challenges are generally challenges of security and exploitation. Teams may have to decipher or decrypt
flags, exploit vulnerabilities in websites or programs, or extract information hidden in images or even sound files.

These competitions are great fun, even for people like myself who are beginners in security exploitation and cryptography. Check out [m0lecon 2020](https://ctf.m0lecon.it/), and [picoCTF](https://picoctf.com/), another well-known CTF that I participated in earlier this year, held by CMU. picoCTF in particular makes its challenges available year-round, even after the competitions are over, so you that can try your hand at the problems at your own pace.
