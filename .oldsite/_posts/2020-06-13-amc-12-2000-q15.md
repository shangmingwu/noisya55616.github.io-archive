It's been a while! This was a math problem that I came across in my AMC 12 practice, that I thought would be a good subject for a blog post.

The problem is as follows:

Let $$f$$ be a function for which $$f(\tfrac{x}{3}) = x^2 + x + 1$$. Find the sum of all values of $$z$$ for which $$f(3z) = 7$$.

The answer choices are:

**(A)** $$-\frac{1}{3}$$

**(B)** $$-\frac{1}{9}$$

**(C)** $$0$$

**(D)** $$\frac{5}{9}$$

**(E)** $$\frac{5}{3}$$

Now, how would we go about solving this? Firstly, let's equate $$z$$ and $$x$$.

$$\begin{eqnarray}
f(\tfrac{x}{3}) &=& f(3z) \nonumber \\
\frac{x}{3} &=& 3z \nonumber \\
x &=& 9z \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}$$

Now, we can substitute z into the equation.

$$x^2 + x + 1 = 81z^2 + 9z + 1$$

$$f(3z) = 7$$, so let's evaluate that.

$$\begin{eqnarray}
f(3z) &=& 7 \nonumber \\
81z^2 + 9z + 1 &=& 7 \nonumber \\
81z^2 + 9z - 6 &=& 0 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}$$

This form looks familiar. Let's use the quadratic formula to find the roots!

$$\begin{eqnarray}
z &=& \frac{-9 \pm \sqrt{9^2 - 4(81)(-6)}}{2(81)} \nonumber \\
&=& \frac{-9 \pm \sqrt{81 - 4(81)(-6)}}{162} \nonumber \\
&=& \frac{-9 \pm \sqrt{1863}}{162}
\end{eqnarray}$$

The sum of the 2 cases is

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{-9 + \sqrt{1863}}{162} + \frac{-9 - \sqrt{1863}}{162} &=& \frac{-9(2)}{162} \nonumber \\
&=& -\frac{1}{9} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}$$

The sum of all of the values of $$z$$ where $$f(3z) = 7$$ is $$-\frac{1}{9}$$. The answer is **(B)**.
