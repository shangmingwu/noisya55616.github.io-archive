# Summary

As I also went over in my [planning reflection post](reflection-planning), my planned demonstration ultimately didn’t pan out. Here, I’ll describe how I was able to move past and find a new solution, and how I iterated through that process as well.

# Initial plans

[My initial plan](on-building-a-spectroscope-or-spectrometer) was to use the prism that I had ordered to build a crude spectrometer, a device that would be able to measure the intensity of light at various wavelengths and display a **quantitative** measurement of the spectrum of light from a source. Unfortunately, this plan didn’t work out for me.

## Irreversible destruction

Through some further research I did as well as some testing I conducted with the webcam I intended to use to take light measurements, I learned that I would have to irreversibly damage my webcam. As it turns out, nearly all cameras sold nowadays - including cell phone cameras, webcams, security cameras, and handheld cameras - have built-in infrared filters. For their intended uses, these infrared filters provide a better picture quality and less interference, but for what I intended to use the camera for, the infrared filter destroyed any chances of cool measurements for me to take.

In order to use my webcam for this, I would have to remove the IR filter, delicately enough to avoid destroying the actual lens. However, with the construction of my webcam (and every other webcam I had available to me), this wouldn’t be feasible without permanent damage. In addition, every single one of the webcams in my household is relied upon for videoconferencing purposes by myself, my brother or my parents, and so destroying any of them would not be an option.

# Moving on

Once I received my prism, I realized that I would still be able to demonstrate something with it - the dispersion of light by a prism, used by real spectrometers and spectroscopes to reveal light spectra. I began to put together the calculations and formulas I would need to demonstrate this, as well as the practical elements I would need.

## One last hurdle

The final hurdle I had to face in building an effective practical demonstration was selecting an appropriate light source. I tried many different options I had available to me, such as this bike-mounted LED flashlight.

None of them displayed a clear spectrum as well as this desk lamp, though, so this is ultimately what I selected in order to display the best spectrum for my demonstration.
