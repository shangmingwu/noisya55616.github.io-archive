# Summary

To understand my Pandemic Physics Personal Project as a whole, I’m going to use a few different metrics to evaluate several different important aspects of what I think indicate success in the PPPP.

# Was I able to demonstrate and perform what I wanted to perform?

I wasn’t successful in doing what I originally set out for myself as a goal - to build a spectrometer that would be able to quantitatively measure light spectra. However, I do think that I made a good effort to put on a demonstration in spite of the setbacks and difficulties that I faced, and that I was able to bring forth the physics behind the spectroscopy demonstration I did.

# How well did I communicate new ideas to my audience?

I think that I communicated new ideas to my audience fairly effectively. I was able to cover a fairly wide range of content within spectroscopy, including its history, roles it played in important physics discoveries, and applications of concepts of physics within different aspects of spectroscopy.

I am also happy that I was able to include and highlight the contributions of marginalized voices in science through my presentation. The discoveries that are made by people outside of the Western white male hegemony that made up science for hundreds of years are often ignored and overshadowed, regardless of their importance and significance to scientific progress.

# How much did I learn through this project?

I learned a lot about physics through this project. I learned about the origins of many physics concepts that I’d read about or heard about in previous science and physics classes, and the ways that they were related. For example, I had read about the ultraviolet catastrophe and Rayleigh-Jean’s law through an external physics class, and Planck’s law while I was studying astrophysics for the IOAA, but my research for this project exposed me to the way that they were related, and why the Rayleigh-Jeans law continued to work at high wavelengths of light.

In addition to everything I went over in my video, there were many concepts I learned about that I didn’t cover in my final PPPP product because they weren’t necessarily as relevant to my project specifically. I still became very interested in them, though, such as some of the more detailed cosmology findings that came from Edwin Hubble and his observations, and Meghnad Saha’s ionization equation. As I mentioned in a previous section and some previous posts, I also learned about the contributions of many people and voices who are often overlooked in the scientific community, and this was really valuable for me personally as a learning experience in the importance of diversity and inclusion in scientific research and education.
