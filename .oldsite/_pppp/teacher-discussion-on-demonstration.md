# Quick update

This is a quick update post to document some feedback I got in a discussion with Mr. Fong about the demonstration I plan to do for this project, and how I should relate it with my chosen topic.

## Topic of discussion

I approached Mr. Fong about a concern I had about the demonstration I wanted to do to accompany the research and analytical work I would present. Because professional spectrometry equipment suitable to study spectra from starlight is prohibitively expensive (in the range of thousands of dollars) I want to build a much cruder spectrograph, to split light coming from common sources (sunlight, lightbulbs, etc.) into a spectrum for viewing.

However, I was worried that because I most likely wouldn't be able to actually demonstrate the spectrum from a star in good enough detail to be useful for study, that the demonstration would be a little too separate from my main topic of spectroscopy in the context of astronomy.

## Response

Mr. Fong's response was essentially as follows:

- As a student, I am obviously not expected to invest thousands of dollars into expensive spectrometry equipment. The demonstration that I outlined would be a sufficient way to explain the topic and concepts that I have chosen for my project.
- However, I should aim to draw parallels between the crude equipment that I construct and the real, professional equipment and procedures used in real research and study of astronomical spectra, in order to sufficiently represent the topic using the simpler demonstration process.

# Moving forward

I plan on incorporating an explanation segment with the demonstration that will specifically outline analogies between my crude spectrographic demonstration and work that is done with a real spectrometer, such as the methods of splitting light into spectra, and the way that professional equipment measures the intensity of the light at the various wavelengths it is split into by spectrometry equipment.

## Spectroscope/spectrometer examples

Image 1. Homemade spectroscope, suitable for children to make, which is one of the possible routes I might take on this project. It uses a CD as a diffraction grating to break light into a spectrum. Primitive as it might seem, it's actually pretty good at displaying visible spectra and demonstrating concepts in spectrometry.

Image 2. More refined homemade spectrometer, which is made of wooden planks painted black. There is a slit in the front to allow light through: not visible is the camera in the back, which has a piece of broken DVD mounted in front of it as a crude diffraction grating, similar to the handheld spectroscope made of the cardboard tube. A project like this would allow me to make quantitative measurements and observe non-visible parts of the spectrum (such as ultraviolet and infrared light) but might be difficult to complete under the time constraint of this year.

Image 3. Optical fibres being plugged into a large aluminum plate: each hole in the plate represents the position of a celestial object that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey wishes to gather spectral data about, and the spectrometer is able to measure spectra from hundreds of different celestial objects at once. This is the kind of equipment that I'll be aiming to approximate and explain with my own crude home experiment. From [the Sloan Digital Sky Survey](http://www.sdss3.org/dr8/spectro/spectro_basics.php)
