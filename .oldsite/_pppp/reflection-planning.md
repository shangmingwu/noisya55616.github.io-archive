# Summary

The planning process for my PPPP on The Physics of Astronomical Spectroscopy was rather scattered in its later stages, and is something that I will endeavour to improve on in the future, whether it’s in school assignments or my own personal projects.

However, I do think that the research process did ultimately lead me to learn a lot about my topic, and resulted in a fairly interesting video to watch - at least for me.

# Timeline

## Phase 1: brainstorming and topics

### Initial brainstorming

[Brainstorming ideas for the PPPP](brainstorming-ideas-for-the-pppp)

Looking back, my initial brainstorming of topics went quite well. I was able to find a few topics that I was very interested in, all of them with interesting physics concepts and applications behind them that I would’ve been able to research and potentially apply.

### Topic selection

[Finalizing my topic selection](finalizing-my-topic-selection)

My topic selection phase was also quite good - I selected a topic I really enjoyed, and I was able to plan out a lot of the further research I would have to do quite well.

I didn’t foresee the difficulties I would face in the practical construction of my demonstrations, but I was ultimately able to adapt and figure out ways to demonstrate the concepts I wanted to (e.g. dispersion of light) with the materials I had on hand, and relate them to the physics concepts and real-world applications they were actually used for.

All-in-all, this phase of planning went quite well.

## Phase 2: secondary research

### Teacher discussion

[Teacher discussion on demonstration](teacher-discussion-on-demonstration)

I’m quite happy that I had this conversation with Mr. Fong - I was able to clear up some of the expectations behind what I was to do and demonstrate, and ultimately this would allow me to overcome the difficulties that I would face later on in my construction.

### Secondary research

[General secondary research](general-secondary-research)

My secondary research process was also quite fruitful, in part due to the foundations I had already set in the brainstorming stages for what I wanted to learn about. I was also able to get a good historical base on the progression of astronomy research and spectroscopy through the ages. I’m happy to have covered important discoveries and advances made by underrepresented voices in the sciences - specifically, a brief feature on Islamic scholar al-Biruni’s observations, Indian astrophysicist Meghnad Saha ionization research and female astronomer Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin’s discovery of the true composition of the Sun and other stars.

## Phase 3: primary research

### Practical research

My practical research is where my planning ultimately fell apart a little. Complications arose - the prism that I’d ordered to conduct some demonstrations was taking a very long time to ship, which was unexpected, given that it was shipping from a location within Ontario, and the spectrometer that I had planned to build would’ve required me to destroy a webcam I relied on for meetings and classes due to the built-in IR filters that greatly inhibited any readings that I tried to do.

However, through my earlier teacher conversation as well as some of the research I did in the secondary research stage, I was able to conduct at least a more rudimentary demonstration of light dispersion through a prism and relate it to real-world spectroscopy and spectrometry equipment.

### Theoretical/application research

My theoretical/application-based research also went quite well, and it especially came in handy when my practical demonstration began to fall apart. I was able to pivot to filling in the knowledge gap that was left by the replaced demonstration with a new calculation-based demonstration on the applications of Planck’s law and Wien’s displacement.
