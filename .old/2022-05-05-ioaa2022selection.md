I competed in the Canadian Astronomy Olympiad and performed well enough to be invited directly to represent Team Canada again, this time at the 15th International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics in Kutaisi, Georgia.

This year's IOAA host country was meant to be Kyiv, Ukraine, but this proved to be untenable due to the Russian invasion. As such, the olympiad has moved to be hosted at Kutaisi International University in Kutaisi, Georgia.

I'm excited to travel to Europe for the first time, and to experience my first in-person olypiad!
