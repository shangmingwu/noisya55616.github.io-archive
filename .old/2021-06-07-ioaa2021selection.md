During the month of May, I participated in the Canadian Astronomical Olympiad. The problems were challenging and engaging, and fortunately for me, I placed high enough to be selected to represent Canada at the 14th International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics!

This year, the IOAA was meant to be held in Bogot√°, Columbia: unfortunately, the competition is most likely to proceed online for this year, as with last year. The olympiad is scheduled for November 2021, though, so there is time for circumstances to change.

I'll be preparing over the coming months for my first international olympiad experience, and I hope that I'll perform well!
